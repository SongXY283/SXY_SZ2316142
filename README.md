This is the official code for "Revisiting Adversarial Robustness Distillation: Robust Soft Labels Make Student Better". The paper can be download [here](https://arxiv.org).

The code for SAT, TRADES and ARD are using the code in https://github.com/MadryLab/cifar10_challenge, https://github.com/yaodongyu/TRADES and https://github.com/goldblum/AdversariallyRobustDistillation.
