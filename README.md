# RSLAD
This is the official code for "Revisiting Adversarial Robustness Distillation: Robust Soft Labels Make Student Better". The paper can be download [here](https://arxiv.org).

# Baseline Implementation
For the training for SAT, TRADES and ARD, we use the code released by offical. The codes are available here([SAT](https://github.com/MadryLab/cifar10_challenge),[TRADES](https://github.com/yaodongyu/TRADES) and [SAT](https://github.com/goldblum/AdversariallyRobustDistillation)).
For the training for IAD, we use the hyper param mentioned in its paper.
